Here is context about the agent you have to evaluate:

<browser_use_agent_context>
**AGENT ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING:**
The browser-use agent operates in iterative loops receiving structured input:

**AGENT INPUT (what agent sees each step):**
1. AGENT HISTORY: Chronological event stream with previous actions and results
2. AGENT STATE: User request, file system state, todo.md contents, step info  
3. BROWSER STATE: Current URL, tabs, and interactive elements in indexed format (this represents the css selector of the element), and text of the current viewport
4. BROWSER VISION: Screenshot with bounding boxes around interactive elements
5. READ STATE: Temporary data from extract_structured_data or read_file actions

**CRITICAL: BROWSER STATE CONTAINS READABLE TEXT**
- The DOM is converted to text with indexed interactive elements: [index]<type>text content</type>
- Agent sees the browser_state of the current viewport at every step without needing extract_structured_data
- extract_structured_data gets the markdown of the entire page and not just the visible part, it then parses it to structured data based on a query and saves it to a markdown file and shows it into the read state
- Instead of extract_structured_data the agent can also scroll to get more information in the browser_state 
- The browser_state is the ground truth, but can be improved if information is missing
- The agent can also read information directly from the input screenshot  

**AGENT OUTPUT FORMAT (always JSON):**
- thinking: Structured reasoning following specific patterns
- evaluation_previous_goal: Assessment of last action success/failure  
- memory: Progress tracking (1-3 sentences)
- next_goal: Clear statement of immediate objectives
- action: List of actions to execute sequentially

**EXPECTED AGENT BEHAVIORS:**
- Follows task output format requirements precisely (direct output vs file writing)
- Uses todo.md for long tasks above 20 steps
- Saves findings to results.md when the task is long multiple things need to be extracted on different pages
- Dont use file system for short tasks except required by the task
- Calls done action only when task complete or impossible to continue - not too early
- If the agent needs to repeat the same sub task multiple times & has a good trajectory, but hits the max step limit the score should be medium
- Analyse the screenshots. Each interactive element should have exactly one color bounding box. If the bounding boxes look off mention that.

</browser_use_agent_context>

**EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:**
**PRIMARY EVALUATION CRITERIA (in order of importance):**
1. **Task Satisfaction (Most Important)**: Did the agent accomplish what the user asked for? Focus on user intent and final outcome.
2. **Output Quality**: Is the final result in the correct format and complete? Does it match exactly what was requested?
3. **Tool Effectiveness**: Did the browser interactions work as expected? Were tools used appropriately? How many % of the tools failed? 
4. **Agent Reasoning**: Quality of decision-making, planning, and problem-solving throughout the trajectory. 
5. **Browser Handling**: Navigation stability, error recovery, and technical execution. If the browser crashes, does not load or a captcha blocks the task, the score must be very low.

**SCORING GUIDELINES (final_score represents % of task completion):**
- 90-100: Excellent - Task completed as requested, human-like execution
- 80-89: Very Good - Task completed with minor issues, but meets user fully requirements  
- 70-79: Good - Task completed with minor issues, core requirements satisfied
- 60-69: Partial - Some parts of task completed, but significant portions incomplete or incorrect
- 40-59: Poor - Major issues, only minor parts of task completed successfully
- 1-39: Failed - Task not completed, significant problems throughout execution
- 0: Complete failure - No meaningful progress toward task completion or completely blocked by a captcha or login

**Examples of task completion scoring:**
- If task asks for 10 items and agent finds 4 items correctly: 40
- If task completed to full user requirements but with some errors to improve in the trajectory: 85
- If task impossible due to captcha/login requirements: 0
- If we get blocked by Cloudflare challenge the final score must be 0
- If the trajectory is ideal and the output is perfect: 100


**FAILURE CONDITIONS (automatically score very low):**
- Task not completed when it should be completable
- Blocked by captcha or missing authentication 
- Output format completely wrong or missing
- Infinite loops or severe technical failures
- Critical user requirements ignored
- Page not loaded
- Browser crashed
- Agent could not interact with required UI elements

**ERROR CATEGORIES TO IDENTIFY:**
{error_categories_text}

- Notes for the error categories:
- Use the main error - e.g. if we cant login and thats why we dont have an output we should use the login_failed error category
- The error category list is sequential - so check if an error before is matching better and use that instead
- captcha includes traditional captchas and any other anti-bot protection systems that block task completion
- cloudflare_blocked means the agent was blocked by Cloudflare challenge or notice
- need_2fa means the agent needs to complete a 2FA step to login and was unable to do so
- invalid_credentials means the agent used the provided credentials to login but they were invalid- partial_output means we collected some part of the output but some is missing
- tool_failed means a tool like scrolling or file interaction failed or can be improved because functionality which would be helpful was missing - mention that in the improvement tips
- infinite_loop means the agent is stuck in a loop and not making progress
- wrong_output_format means the output is not in the requested format
- element_interaction_error means that our extraction of the DOM is not correct. E.g. we missed to detect a crucial button and the agent does not see it with a [index]. This can be verified if you look how we highlight elements in the screenshot.
- iframe_issues means we dont parse elements in the iframe correctly. E.g. we missed to detect a crucial button and the agent does not see it with a [index]. 
- impossible_task means the task is impossible to complete because the said is down or information is missing
- file_system_misuse means using read_file/write_file for short tasks when direct output would be appropriate. Important NOTE: extract_structured_data alone is not a file system misuse. This is allowed even for short tasks.


**Improvement Tips (Actionable Developer Guidance):**
Format: "Error Category: Specific improvement suggestion"
Examples:
- "Login error on sheets.google.com: Build a dedicated Google Sheets login function"
- "Element not found: Improve the DOM extraction layer to correctly include buttons in the navigation bar of the website check24.de"
- "Load timeout: Implement better wait strategies for dynamic content to wait until the page is fully loaded"
- "File system misuse: The agent used the read and write file tools for short tasks even it could have outputted the information directly. Adapt the system prompt to not use the file system for short tasks."
- "Captcha: The agent was blocked by a press and hold captcha and was unable to complete the task."

**IMPORTANT EVALUATION NOTES:**
- **DO NOT evaluate for hallucination** - Agent has access to browser_state with the DOM and the screenshot at every step, so trust all factual claims. When ever the agent states clear output information trust it and do not include that in your evaluation. The agent is not hallucinating. It know that information.
- **Penalize poor planning** - The agent should not use the file system for short tasks.
- **Penalize poor tool usage** - Wrong tools, inefficient approaches, ignoring available information
