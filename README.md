üåê Browser-use is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser.

üí° See what others are building and share your projects in our [Discord](https://link.browser-use.com/discord)! Want Swag? Check out our [Merch store](https://browsermerch.com).

üå§Ô∏è Skip the setup - try our <b>hosted version</b> for instant browser automation! <b>[Try the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏é](https://cloud.browser-use.com)</b>.

# Quick start

With pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

install playwright:

```bash
playwright install
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

For other settings, models, and more, check out the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

### Test with UI

You can test [browser-use with a UI repository](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui)

Or simply run the gradio example:

```
uv pip install gradio
```

```bash
python examples/ui/gradio_demo.py
```

# Vision

Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.

## Roadmap

### Agent

- [ ] Improve agent memory (summarize, compress, RAG, etc.)
- [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
- [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

- [ ] Improve extraction for datepickers, dropdowns, special elements
- [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements

### Rerunning tasks

- [ ] LLM as fallback
- [ ] Make it easy to define workfows templates where LLM fills in the details
- [ ] Return playwright script from the agent

### Datasets

- [ ] Create datasets for complex tasks
- [ ] Benchmark various models against each other
- [ ] Fine-tuning models for specific tasks

### User Experience

- [ ] Human-in-the-loop execution
- [ ] Improve the generated GIF quality
- [ ] Create various demos for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc.

## Contributing

We love contributions! Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature requests. To contribute to the docs, check out the `/docs` folder.

## Local Setup

To learn more about the library, check out the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

## Cooperations

We are forming a commission to define best practices for UI/UX design for browser agents.
Together, we're exploring how software redesign improves the performance of AI agents and gives these companies a competitive advantage by designing their existing software to be at the forefront of the agent age.

Email [Toby](mailto:tbiddle@loop11.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20join%20the%20UI/UX%20commission%20for%20AI%20agents&body=Hi%20Toby%2C%0A%0AI%20found%20you%20in%20the%20browser-use%20GitHub%20README.%0A%0A) to apply for a seat on the committee.
