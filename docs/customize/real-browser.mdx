## Overview

You can connect the agent to your real Chrome browser instance, allowing it to access your existing browser profile with all your logged-in accounts and settings. This is particularly useful when you want the agent to interact with services where you're already authenticated.

<Note>
  First make sure to close all running Chrome instances.

## Basic Configuration

To connect to your real Chrome browser, you'll need to specify the path to your Chrome executable when creating the Browser instance:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, Browser, BrowserConfig
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import asyncio
# Configure the browser to connect to your Chrome instance
browser = Browser(
    config=BrowserConfig(
        # Specify the path to your Chrome executable
        chrome_instance_path='/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome',  # macOS path
        # For Windows, typically: 'C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'
        # For Linux, typically: '/usr/bin/google-chrome'
    )
)

# Create the agent with your configured browser
agent = Agent(
    task="Your task here",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o'),
    browser=browser,
)

async def main():
    await agent.run()

    input('Press Enter to close the browser...')
    await browser.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```


<Note>
  When using your real browser, the agent will have access to all your logged-in sessions. Make sure to ALWAYS review the task you're giving to the agent and ensure it aligns with your security requirements!
