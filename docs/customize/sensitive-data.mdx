## Handling Sensitive Data

When working with sensitive information like passwords, you can use the `sensitive_data` parameter to prevent the model from seeing the actual values while still allowing it to reference them in its actions.

Here's an example of how to use sensitive data:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent

load_dotenv()

# Initialize the model
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model='gpt-4o',
    temperature=0.0,
)

# Define sensitive data
# The model will only see the keys (x_name, x_password) but never the actual values
sensitive_data = {'x_name': 'magnus', 'x_password': '12345678'}

# Use the placeholder names in your task description
task = 'go to x.com and login with x_name and x_password then write a post about the meaning of life'

# Pass the sensitive data to the agent
agent = Agent(task=task, llm=llm, sensitive_data=sensitive_data)

async def main():
    await agent.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example:
1. The model only sees `x_name` and `x_password` as placeholders.
2. When the model wants to use your password it outputs x_password - and we replace it with the actual value.
3. When your password is visable on the current page, we replace it in the LLM input - so that the model never has it in its state. 

Warning: Vision models still see the image of the page - where the sensitive data might be visible.

This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure while still allowing the agent to perform tasks that require authentication.
