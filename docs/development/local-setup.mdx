## Prerequisites

Browser Use requires Python 3.11 or higher. We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python environment management.

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the Browser Use repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use
cd browser-use
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install the package in editable mode with all development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

<Note>
  The `-e` flag installs the package in "editable" mode, which means your local code changes
  will be reflected immediately without requiring reinstallation. The `[dev]` part installs
  additional dependencies needed for development.
</Note>

## Configuration

Set up your environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Or manually create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

<Note>
  You can use any LLM model supported by LangChain. See [LangChain
  Models](/customize/supported-models) for available options and their specific
  API key requirements.
</Note>

## Development

After setup, you can:

- Run tests with `pytest`
- Build the package with `hatch build`
- Try the examples in the `examples/` directory
