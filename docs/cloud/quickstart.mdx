The Browser Use Cloud API lets you create and manage browser automation agents programmatically. Each agent can execute tasks and provide real-time feedback through a live preview URL.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  You need an active subscription and an API key from
  [cloud.browser-use.com/billing](https://cloud.browser-use.com/billing)
</Note>

## Pricing

The Browser Use Cloud API is priced at <b>$0.05 per step</b> that the agent executes.

<Note>
  Since Browser Use can execute multiple steps at the same time,
  the price for filling out forms is much lower than other services.
</Note>

## Creating Your First Agent

Create a new browser automation task by providing instructions in natural language:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.browser-use.com/api/v1/run-task \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "Go to google.com and search for Browser Use"
  }'
```

The API returns a task ID that you can use to manage the task and check the live preview URL.

<Note>
  The task response includes a `live_url` that you can embed in an iframe to
  watch and control the agent in real-time.
</Note>

## Managing Tasks

Control running tasks with these operations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pause/Resume Tasks">
    Temporarily pause task execution with [`/api/v1/pause-task`](/cloud/api-v1/pause-task) and resume with
    [`/api/v1/resume-task`](/cloud/api-v1/resume-task). Useful for manual inspection or intervention.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stop Tasks">
    Permanently stop a task using [`/api/v1/stop-task`](/cloud/api-v1/stop-task). The task cannot be
    resumed after being stopped.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For detailed API documentation, see the tabs on the left, which include the full coverage of the API.

## Building your own client (OpenAPI)

<Note>
  We recommend this only if you don't need control and only need to run simple
  tasks.
</Note>

The best way to build your own client is to use our [OpenAPI specification](http://api.browser-use.com/openapi.json) to generate a type-safe client library.

### Python

Use [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client) to generate a modern Python client:

```bash
# Install the generator
pipx install openapi-python-client --include-deps

# Generate the client
openapi-python-client generate --url http://api.browser-use.com/openapi.json
```

This will create a Python package with full type hints, modern dataclasses, and async support.

### TypeScript/JavaScript

For TypeScript projects, use [openapi-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript) to generate type definitions:

```bash
# Install the generator
npm install -D openapi-typescript

# Generate the types
npx openapi-typescript http://api.browser-use.com/openapi.json -o browser-use-api.ts
```

This will create TypeScript definitions you can use with your preferred HTTP client.
